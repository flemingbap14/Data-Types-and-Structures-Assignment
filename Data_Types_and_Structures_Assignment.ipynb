This means that when you iterate over a dictionary, you couldn’t rely on the order in which the key-value pairs were stored. However, starting from Python 3.7, dictionaries maintain insertion order (i.e., the order in which items were added), although this property is still considered an implementation detail rather than a fundamental characteristic of dictionaries."
